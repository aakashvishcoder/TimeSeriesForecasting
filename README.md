# TimeSeriesForecasting

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network implemented in PyTorch to predict stock prices based on historical data.
The model is trained on 60-day sliding windows of stock closing prices and predicts the next day's closing price.

The project demonstrates:

- Time series forecasting using deep learning.
- Data preprocessing with MinMax scaling & sequence generation.
- Model training and evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)
- yFinance (Stock Data Collection)
- Scikit-learn (Data Scaling)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)
